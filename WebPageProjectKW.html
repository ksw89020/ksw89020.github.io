Before I came to the University of Georgia I knew I was going to need to find new ways to spend my freetime. I told myself I didn't want to play on any sports teams so I found a gym, Orange Theory, as a way to stay in shape. I also joined a business fraternity, Pi Sigma Epsilon, as a way to get involved with something related to my major. Since I was did a lot of community service in high school, I was drawn to UGA's Miracle. Miracle is one of the largest organizations at UGA and its focus is raising money for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

<p>
My favorite organization that I have had the opportunity to be apart of is Zeta Tau Alpha, Gamma Pi Chapter. This has become my favorite thing because of the people it has brought into my life. The philanthropy for my sorority is <b>Breast Cancer Awareness and Education</b>, which raises money to fight against breast cancer.
